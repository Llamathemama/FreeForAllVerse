Setup is self explanatory
Add a Timer, EndGameDevice
For the corners put them in the two most corners of the map
Adjust corners and use "Test Mode" to get the exact arrangement
For the TestProp just click any random prop it doesnt matter
Adjust Rows and Collumns depending on how many players per row etc...
